# ReXpwr (RePurpose X-Powers)
Breakout boards and arduino libraries for various X-Powers Power Management IC's

There are too many cheap chinese tablet mainboards as e-waste around the world. This project aims to repurpose Power Management IC's of those e-wasted boards.
AXPxxx PMIC's have various DC DC converters , ldos , battery chargers and fuel gauges(some models) inside of them which is pretty useful for any microcontroller and fpga projects.
